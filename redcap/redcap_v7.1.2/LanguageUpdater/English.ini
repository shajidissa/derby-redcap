This is sometimes called one-to-many data collection, in which a project can have one or more repeating parts. For example, if each record in a hypothetical project represents a person, then one might have a repeating instrument for medications, one for family members, one or adverse events, and one for collecting data over multiple visits (or weekly surveys), so that each repeating element is connected to the overall record but can repeat independently of the other instruments. So if using repeating instruments or repeating events, each record in the project can have a different number of repeated instances of any given instrument or event. One record may have five medications, but another may have two or none, for example. Such flexibility makes this feature very powerful, and setting up repeating instruments and/or repeating events in a project is very quick and easy. The repeating instruments/events feature can be enabled and set up by clicking the Enable button in the Optional Modules section on the Project Setup page."

However, with the repeating instruments functionality, one does not need to specify how many repetitions will needed ahead of time; one can simply repeat an instrument an unlimited amount of times. It is important to note that multiple instruments in a project can be enabled as repeating instruments (even all of them, if one wishes). Projects utilizing the longitudinal module can have repeating instruments as well, in which one or more instruments on any defined event can be set to repeat within that event. The repeating instruments functionality behaves very much the same way in both classic and longitudinal projects."

This might be useful if one has several instruments whose data correlates together, such as completing multiple surveys back to back for a specific time-point or visit, for example. Previously, one may have had to create X number of identical events to capture repeating data for the instruments on those events (e.g., Week 1, Week 2, ...), but the repeating events feature makes this much simpler by allowing one to create only one single event that can be repeated in unlimited fashion."

So it is one additional step to do after enabling the instrument itself as a repeating instrument. When the repeat survey setting is enabled, it will display a button at the end of the survey so that the respondent can choose to enter another response for the survey, thus essentially allowing them to take the survey multiple times in a row. In this way, they will be able to enter as many responses for that same survey as they need. For example, if a REDCap project is aimed at mothers, and the repeating survey is for collecting data about each of the mother's children, the mother could complete the survey once for each child, thus allowing mothers with one child or six children to easily enter their data in a quick back-to-back fashion by repeating the survey.

	that you may choose one of the choices. Otherwise, if it is not a multiple choice field, it will instead provide a text box for entering the filter value."
report_builder_121 = "Using ANDs and ORs with multiple fields allow you to do more complex filtering. If you have two filters with an AND
	between them, for example,
	that means that it will apply both of them together when filtering, but if you use OR, it will return results
	that apply to just one or the other. In general, using AND will often constrict the results further by returning less data in the report than
	when using OR."
report_builder_122 = "There is no limit to how many times you may use a field as a filter in a single report.
	TIP: If you want to find instances in your data where a field's value
	is blank/null, then just leave the value text box blank. Conversely, to find instances where the field has a value (i.e., is non-blank), set
	the operator as 'not =' with a blank text box."
report_builder_123 = "If you have filtering that uses both OR and AND, it is very important to know the order in which REDCap evaluates
	the ORs and ANDs to ensure that your logic behaves how you expect.
	Essentially, all the ORs are evaluated for consecutive filter fields as a group, and all the groups are then evaluated as ANDs with each other.
	For example, it looks like (this OR this OR this) AND (this OR this OR this), in which all the ORs inside the parentheses are evaluated
	first and then those groups of ORs are then evaluated together using ANDs."
report_builder_124 = "If you wish to do even more complex filtering, you may choose to switch the filtering format over to the 'Advanced Logic', which allows
	you to hand-type the filtering logic in a big text box. The filter logic is essentially the same kind of syntax as Branching Logic and Calculated field
	equations, in which you may use all the special functions, such as if(), datediff(), and various mathematical functions, in your filtering logic.
	REDCap will double check your hand-typed logic for any syntax errors, and it will not allow you to save the report until all errors
	have been resolved. When using the Advanced Logic, just make sure that your logic
	ultimately evaluates to either TRUE or FALSE and that it does *not* evaluate to a value, such as a number. For example,
	datediff([dob], 'today', 'y') is not valid because it will evaluate to a number, but datediff([dob], 'today', 'y') > 30 is valid

	Please note that any user that has 'Add/Edit Reports' user privileges will be able to view
	*all* reports in the project. This does not cause any user rights conflictions because reports do not give users access to any data to
	which they do not already have access. In other words, if a user was not given form-level access to a particular data
	collection instrument, then they will still not be able to view data from that instrument inside any report. The same goes
	if the user is assigned to a Data Access Group, in which case they will still only be able to view data from records in their
	own DAG. So even though a user may have 'Add/Edit Reports' privileges and may thus be able to view reports to which they have not been
	given explicit access, they will not be able to view data to which they do not already have access. So implementing user access for
	a report is not quite the same as setting someone's user privileges. Reports merely act as a window, so to speak, for viewing a subset
	of the data to which a user has access, in which user privileges are employed when viewing a report. But user access controls for a

	easy to go to Twilio.com and create one.
	Once your REDCap project is connected to your Twilio account by entering your Twilio account credentials on your REDCap project's

	In general, not much is different between administering a survey normally in REDCap than when using

	external system."

ws_45 = "A user on the DDP mapping/setup page can choose any available fields from the external source system to map to one of their REDCap project fields.
	(Note: This assumes that the user has already created their data collection instruments and fields in their project.)
	There are two types of fields that may be mapped: 1) one-time data fields, and 2) temporal data fields.
	One-time data fields are those where data will only
	be stored one time in the source system, such as demography data. Conversely, temporal data fields are those where data may be collected many
	times over a period of time (e.g., labs, vitals, any kind of longitudinal data). When mapping temporal fields, you must also specify a
	REDCap date/datetime field that will be used for determining the window of time in which the DDP should look when fetching data from the source system.
	It will determine the window of time in conjunction with the day offset value defined on the mapping page.
	For example, if the value of the mapped REDCap date/datetime field is 2001-11-29 and the day offset is 1 day, it will query the source system and return only
	data saved for the field from 2001-11-28 until 2001-11-30. Any source data outside of that range will be ignored during the adjudication process.
	It is important to note that the source data for a temporal field will NOT be fetched from the external source system UNLESS its associated
	REDCap date/datetime field has a value. Once a value is entered for the associated date/datetime field, source data will then be fetched for that temporal field."
ws_46 = "Preview fields (optional)"

	that the record identifier (e.g. medical record number) that was entered is correct by displaying other contextual data from the source system. For example, if you
	have 'last name' and 'date of birth' as source fields, you may choose them to be preview fields in your project, and thus when a value is entered in REDCap as the record
	identifier, if will then fetch and display the last name and date of birth of the person to validate their identity. If preview fields are not utilized, it is
